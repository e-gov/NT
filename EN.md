# Consent Service

Consent Service is an initiative led by the Estonian Information System Authority to build a universal, decentralized and scalable solultion for managing consents used for data processing. Reference architecture along with the first prototype was published in December 2019 with the development of a fully functional MVP following in 2020-2021. Several pilots are planned in the second half of 2021 with financial data as the first priority. Main use cases include sharing personal data from public sector databases to private sector entities for the purpose of creating highly personalized value adding services. 

## Instructions for using the Consent Service (English version coming soon)

## Consent giving use case prototype

The prototype shows consent giving proscess and was used in testing of visual solution and UX. The prototype consists of mobile views that can be navigated between by clicking on "active" buttons. The prototype is based on the Medikeep mobile application use case. The process begins in Medikeep application, from there the user is redirected to the Consent Service to give the consent, and ends also in Medikeep application, to which the user is redirected after giving the consent.

## Architecture

Architecture document gives an overview of the Consent Service technical structure, defining system components, integrations, deployment diagram, data models etc.
