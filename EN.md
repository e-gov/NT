# Consent Service

Consent Service is an initiative led by the Estonian Information System Authority to build a universal, decentralized and scalable solultion for managing consents used for data processing. Reference architecture along with the first prototype was published in December 2019 and several pilots are planned in the second half of 2020 with healthcare data as the first priority. Main use cases include sharing personal data from public sector databases to private sector entities for the purpose of creating highly personalized value adding services. 

## Prototype

The aim of the prototype is to validate the current consent service architecture and protocol through demonstrating potential use-cases from health sector. The prototype demonstrates the setup phase, end-user interfaces and the messages exchanged between the involved parties, providing a better understanding of such a system.

Service provider - Health Information System, containing the protected health data
Client - HealthStartup, wants access to the protected data in order to provide personalized services
Consent Service at TEHIK (Health and Welfare Information Systems Centre) - the provider of consent service

The required information in the setup phase (declaring services and purposes) is largely predefined.

## Feedback and suggestions

If you want to be a part of the development process by raising issues and providing feedback, please use the "Issues" tab in this repository. Even if the majority is in Estonian, the Estonian Information System Authority will deal with translations once it becomes necessary.
